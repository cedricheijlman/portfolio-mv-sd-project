        <p>
          Hi! I'm Sharon van Rees and I am a graphic design student at ROC MBO College.
          This is what I have done so far and what I liked the most while working 
          on the graphic design projects.

        <h2>My work and projects</h2>
        <p>
          I have worked on a lot of assignments and mini-projects in the past 5
          months or so. I really enjoyed making them and also enjoyed learning
          new abilities. Hopefully I will make more in the future.
        </p>

        <div class="workAndProjects__text"><p>The things I've learned so far are the bascis of: <br>
          - Illustrator <br>
          - Photoshop<br>
          - Indesign 
          </p><p>It's been pretty cool to learn all of these new things!
            The middle one 'The old times' magazine is sort of a combination made in Indesign and Illustrator. 
           I liked this one the best because I liked how I looked.
           The two upper right bars are webbanners and I chose them because that one is
           an actual pun. This is a combination of Photoshop and Illustrator. </p></div>

        <h2>My future<h2>
            <p>
              As for my future I want to be an illustrator or a painter. 
              I like drawing and painting, as you can see. 
              For the rest I don't really mind working as a freelancer, 
              it would be fun to work for yourself and get payed as you 
              work instead of at the end of the month.</p>
